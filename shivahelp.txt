***Data source URL***Click on the spreadsheet icon to the right of 'Data source url' to access a list of your Google Docs Spreadsheets from within SHIVA. You may be prompted to authorize access (read-only) to your Google account. You should then be able to select a spreadsheet from the provided list.<br/> <br/>
Alternately, you can paste the URL provided through the Share link of your Google Doc. Note you have to change the Share settings for the Spreadsheet to either 'Public' or 'Anyone with the link'.  
<br/><br/>If you do not provide a source, some sample data is provided to set the look and feel of the visualization element.

***Data filter***Clicking on the Data filter text box will bring up an interactive box that allows you to perform queries on your data.  These queries allow you to filter the data available in your spreadsheet if you so choose. 
<br/><br/>For example, say you have a spreadsheet that lists all the countries that participated in the Olympics. The spreadsheet also lists the number of gold, silver, and bronze medals each country received. If you only want your chart to show the countries that received more than 50 gold medals, you can set the parameters of the Data filter to achieve this goal. 
<br/><br/>For more information and a walk through of all your Data Filter options please see documentation <a href='https://wiki.shanti.virginia.edu/display/KB/Filter+Visuals+Data' target='_blank'> here</a>.

***3D chart?***From the drop-down menu to the right, choose whether or not to display a 3D version of your chart.

The chosen color will appear in the selected tab at the top, as well as in the preview box in the bottom right. To choose a second or subsequent color click a blank tab at the top of the color picker and follow the same steps as above. Click 'OK' when finished. For further information on using the color picker, please visit <a href='https://wiki.shanti.virginia.edu/display/KB/Choose+Colors' target='_blank'>this link</a>.

***Date format***Click on the text box on the right to enter the format used to display the date information in the top right corner. This should match the format of the date used in your spreadsheet; either 'MMMM dd, yyyy' for a plain date, or 'HH:mm MMMM dd, yyyy' for a date and time. 'MMMM' will display the name of the month, whereas 'MM' will display the month number. Standard date delimiters are permitted, such as 'MM/dd/yyyy' and 'dd-MM-yyyy (HH:mm)'.

***Alpha fill 0-100***Click on the text box to the right to enter a numeric value that represents the opacity of the the area below the chart lines, which is the same color as the chart line. A value of 0 is completely transparent. The higher the number, the more the opacity, with a value of 100 being completely opaque.

***Opacity of area chart***Click on the text box to the right to enter a numeric value that represents the opacity of the the area below the chart lines, which is the same color as the chart line. A value of 0 is completely transparent. The higher the number, the more the opacity, with a value of 1 being completely opaque.

***Chart area setting(s)***Clicking on the text box to the right will open a popup that allows you to configure the placement and size of the chart area, i.e. where the chart itself is drawn, excluding axis and legends. 'Left' sets the offset of your chart from the left side of the canvas. 'Top' sets the offset of your chart from the top of the canvas. 'Height' and 'Width' set the height and width of the visualization itself rather than the size of the canvas. Two formats are supported: a number or a percentage.

***Font name***Click on the text box to the right and enter the name of the font of your choice. Try to use standard fonts, such as Arial, Courier, Georgia, Helvetica, and Times Roman, to ensure that the viewer's computer has that font.

***Font size***Click on the text box to the right and enter a numerical font size of your choice. The automatic font size is 12. This number can be as small as 1. Note that font sizes 100 or larger create problems rendering the chart and may require you to make your chart larger by changing the width and height.

***Horizontal axis setting(s)***Click on the text box to the right to open a dialog that allows you to configure the settings for your horizontal axis.
<br/><br/>For more information on horizontal axis settings please visit <a href='http://code.google.com/apis/chart/interactive/docs/gallery/columnchart.html#Configuration_Options'>this link</a> and look at the 'hAxis' settings in the table of configuration options.

Any field left blank will be automatically filled with default values.<br/><br/>Note that larger font sizes may result in problems with fully rendering your chart.  If you encounter this issue you may need to increase the height and width of your chart.  

***Height of chart***Enter a number in the text box to the right that sets the height of your visualization. This is the total height of the visualization's canvas that may include the legend, axis labels, header, and/or footer. Minimum value is 1,  and the maximum value varies by chart type.  Some charts have a maximum height of 400.  Other charts can grow into the tens of thousands, but be aware that the program slows down as it tries to render large charts. Note that in some charts smaller values will cause a scrollbar to appear on the right of the visualization. 

***Stacked chart?***Choose an option from the drop-down menu to the right to either stack the curves in your visualization or to overlay them atop one another. 

***Line width***In the text box to the right set the pixel width of the lines in your visualization. Enter a number from 1 and up in the text box to the right. Note that larger line widths may create rendering problems and may require you to make your chart larger by changing the width and height.

***Size of points***In the text box to the right enter a value for the size of the points in your visualization. The minimum value is 1.

***Series setting(s)***The Series option in charts with multiple series (e.g. Area, Bar, Column, Line) allows you to display multiple sets of data using different chart styles, for example an area chart showing one series, a line chart showing the second and a bars charts showing the third. Set each chart's point size and line width by typing a number of  factors separated by commas.<br/><br/>The 1st factor is what data set to change, 0 for the 1st, 1 for the second etc.<br/>The type is set by adding type=xxx, where xxx can be a line, area, bars, or stepped area.<br/>Point size is set by adding pointSize=xxx, where xxx is the size (i.e. 12)<br/>Line width is set by adding lineWidth=xxx, where xxx is the width (i.e. 4)<br/><br/>For example:<br/><i>0,type=area,1,type=bars,2,type=steppedArea</i><br/><br/> For detailed documentation on the 'Series settings(s)' option please visit <a href='https://wiki.shanti.virginia.edu/display/KB/Common+Customization+Options#CommonCustomizationOptions-Seriessetting(s)' target='_blank'>this link.</a>

To set the color of the font either enter a hexadecimal color value in the text box to the right of 'Color', or click on the square color chip icon in that box to launch the color picker and select a value there. Any field left blank will be automatically filled with default values.<br/><br/>Note that larger font sizes may result in problems with fully rendering your chart.  If you encounter this issue you may need to increase the height and width of your chart.  

***Tooltip setting(s)***Click on the text box to the right to open a dialog that allows you to specify the tooltip text style. For 'Font' enter a font name, for 'Size' enter a font size, and 'Color' pick a color from the color picker to set the font color.

Click on a node to view its children, right click to move back up the tree to the parent.  Each node is displayed as a rectangle, sized and colored according to values that you assign. Sizes and colors are valued relative to all other nodes in the graph. You can specify how many levels to display simultaneously, and optionally to display deeper levels in a hinted fashion.<br/><br/>You can find out more information on Tree Maps <a href='http://support.google.com/docs/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=1409806' target='_blank'> here</a>.<br/><br/>You can find a sample spreadsheet that can be used to make a Tree Map <a href='https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AsMQEd_YoBWldHdDWkhsQkJLQl93ZW5HQ0d1UFJfaUE&hl=en_US#gid=0' target='_blank'> here</a>.
